Objective
---------

Replicating the default [Cleaver](https://jdan.github.io/cleaver/) theme so I can easier fork my own variant.

Notes
-----

- `author.mustache` can't be overridden

Todo
----

- find a way to update Cleaver repo files automatically via build/make file
- The usage of `object-fit` for images won't work in IE currently
- Centering images via `transform` doesn't work on older browsers / Opera Mini
